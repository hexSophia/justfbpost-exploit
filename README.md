# JustFBPost API Python Script
This repository contains a Python script that allows you to post content using the JustFBPost API. Additionally, it includes an old exploit that forces the post to be sent without undergoing verification.

# Why Release This?
I decided to release this script because the exploit has been fixed, but the API spammer is still functional. Since I no longer have a need for it, I thought it might be useful to others who are interested in testing or exploring the functionality.

# Any Issues?
I want to highlight that this script was written quickly, and the code might not be the most elegant. It specifically focuses on the exploit script, which was developed solely for testing purposes. Keep in mind that using this script might require the use of proxies or VPNs for certain scenarios.

# How Does It Work?
The script utilizes a simple Fiddler tool for interception and manipulation of requests. By capturing the verification requests (such as accepting or denying a post), I discovered that the acceptance of a post does not require verification cookies. Essentially, this means that any post, including reposts, can be accepted by using their respective IDs. To automate this process, I created a Python script.

# Credits
The script in this repository was developed by me. Feel free to explore, modify, or adapt it to suit your needs.
